# Xml Complete

This extension should help with editing XML files with schema location set:
```xml
<root
...
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation="file:///C:/Users/rogalmic/Documents/src/Avalonia/src/Markup/Avalonia.xsd"
/>
```

This extension does not require any runtime like `java` or `python`.

## Features

Plans:
- no platform dependencies ever [**done**]
- no excessive configuration in VSCode [**done**]
- XSD reading from XML schemaLocation attribute [**ongoing**]
- basic and realtime linter (XML + optional XSD) [**ongoing**]
- fast autocomplete based on XSD [**ongoing**]
- formatting XML [**planned**]

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.
